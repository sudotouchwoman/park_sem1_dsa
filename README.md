# **Data structures and algorithms**

Contains problems I solved (or tried my best to solve) for course on data structures and algorithms

+ `mod-1` is about basic algorithms, sorting, binary search and basic data structures. I implemented deque with circular buffer, bisearch and priority queue on heap.

+ `mod-2` is about hash tables and trees (WIP)
