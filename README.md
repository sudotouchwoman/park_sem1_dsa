# **Introduction to data structures and algorithms**

Contains problems I solved (or tried my best to solve) for course on data structures and algorithms at VK education.

+ `mod-1` is about basic algorithms, sorting, binary search and basic data structures. I implemented deque with circular buffer, bisearch and priority queue on heap.

+ `mod-2` is about hash tables and trees. I implemented vanilla BST and in-order traversal for it, AVL-tree and tried to implement B-tree.

+ `mod-3` is about graphs and algorithms related to them. These include several implementations of IGraph interface (via adjacency matrix, lists or sets), BFS for shortest path counting in multigraph and Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm, of course.
